# Privacy Mirror

**AMD Slingshot Hackathon — AI + Cybersecurity Track**

Privacy Mirror is an AI-powered digital footprint reconstruction tool. Enter an email address and watch AI rebuild your digital identity in real time — exposing breach history, dark web presence, threat vectors, and a personality profile inferred from your leaked data.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [privacy-mirror.vercel.app](https://privacy-mirror.vercel.app)

## What It Does

Most people have no idea how much of their personal data is publicly available, actively traded, and cross-referenced across hundreds of databases. Privacy Mirror makes that invisible threat visible — and actionable.

### Features

- **Creepy Score** — A 0–100 exposure rating calculated from breach count, data types leaked, and severity
- **Breach Detection** — Identifies exposure across 160+ real services including LinkedIn, Facebook, Zomato, Domino's India, JusPay, AT&T, 23andMe, Ashley Madison, and more
- **Breach Timeline** — Interactive visual history of when your data was exposed over the years
- **AI Personality Profiler** — AI infers your age range, profession, interests, and lifestyle from your breach metadata in real time
- **Dark Web Threat Intelligence** — AI estimates dark web mention count, whether your data is actively for sale, its market price, and active threat vectors targeting your profile
- **AI Password Analyser** — Real-time AI analysis of password strength, entropy, crack time, and specific improvement suggestions
- **AI Phishing URL Detector** — Paste any suspicious link and AI checks for typosquatting, homograph attacks, deceptive subdomains, and social engineering techniques
- **Remediation Plan** — Personalised action steps tailored to the specific breaches found
- **Email Validation** — Rejects invalid input before scanning

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite |
| Styling | CSS Modules |
| Backend Proxy | Node.js + Express |
| AI Model | Llama 3.3 70B via Groq API (see note below) |
| Frontend Hosting | Vercel |
| Backend Hosting | Render |
| Breach Data | Curated dataset of 160+ real-world breaches |

### A Note on the AI Model

This project was built for the AMD Slingshot Hackathon where compute resources are limited during development. We are using **Llama 3.3 70B via Groq** as it offers a free tier suitable for hackathon prototyping.

**In production, this would run on `claude-sonnet-4-6` (Anthropic).** Claude Sonnet produces significantly more nuanced personality profiles, more accurate threat intelligence, and better-calibrated password analysis. The architecture is designed for a one-line swap — just change the API endpoint and model name in `src/services/claude.js`. The AMD Instinct MI300X would handle self-hosted LLM inference at scale, delivering the sub-2 second response times the product requires.

## What We Tried

### HaveIBeenPwned API Integration
We attempted to integrate the [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) API for real-time breach lookups. The backend proxy route was built and tested successfully:

```
GET /api/breach/:email
→ https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breachedaccount/{email}
```

However we ran into two blockers for the hackathon:

1. **Paid API key required** — HaveIBeenPwned charges $3.50/month with no free tier
2. **Rate limiting** — The API enforces a 1 request per 1500ms limit which would cause failures during a live demo with multiple emails

We made the decision to use a curated hardcoded breach dataset of 160+ real services instead, which guarantees reliable and dramatic results on stage. In production, the HIBP integration is ready to enable with just an API key.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- A Groq API key — free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AkshatSharma-cs/Privacy-Mirror.git
cd Privacy-Mirror/privacy-mirror

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env
```

### Running Locally

You need two terminals running simultaneously:

**Terminal 1 — Backend proxy:**
```bash
node server.js
# Output: Proxy running on http://localhost:3001
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Output: Local: http://localhost:5173
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Demo Profiles

These emails are hardcoded with dramatic results for live demos:

| Email | Score | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `safe@protonmail.com` | 12 | Low Exposure |
| `newuser@outlook.com` | 18 | Low Exposure |
| `privacy@tutanota.com` | 9 | Clean |
| `john.smith@gmail.com` | 94 | Critical |
| `sarah.jones@hotmail.com` | 91 | Critical |
| `mike.wilson@yahoo.com` | 97 | Critical |

Any other valid email generates a randomised result drawn from the 160+ breach pool.

## How the AI Works

Four separate AI calls power the product:

1. **Profile Generation** — Breach metadata is fed into the LLM which infers demographic and behavioural patterns unique to each scan
2. **Threat Intelligence** — LLM estimates dark web exposure, market value of the data bundle, and active threat vectors
3. **Password Analysis** — LLM calculates entropy, crack time, and specific weaknesses for any password entered
4. **Phishing Detection** — LLM analyses URL structure for typosquatting, homograph attacks, suspicious subdomains, and social engineering patterns

All AI calls are proxied through a backend Express server to keep API keys off the client.

---

## Deployment

| Service | Platform | URL |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Vercel | Auto-deploys on push to main |
| Backend | Render (free tier) | Auto-deploys on push to main |

Note: Render's free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first request after idle takes ~30 seconds to wake up. Open the app a couple of minutes before any live demo.
